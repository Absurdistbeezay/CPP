<h2>DENTAL APPOINTMENT CONSOLE APP</h2>
<p>This problem is a part of my practice assignment based on Joyce Farrell's Book <i>'Object Oriented Programming Using C++'</i></p>

<p>The exercise problem states something like this: </p>

<p>
Create a class named DentalAppointment. Include fields for a patient’s data (use the
Person class from Exercise 3), the date (using the Date class from Exercise 2), the time
(use the Time class from Exercise 4), and the duration of the appointment in minutes.
Also include a field that contains the ending time of the appointment; this field will be
calculated based on the start time and the duration using the Time class function that adds 
minutes to a Time object. The DentalAppointment constructor requires a first
and last name, and a month, day, year, hour, and minute for the appointment. Allow a
DentalAppointment to be constructed with or without an additional argument for
appointment duration, and force the duration to 30 minutes when no argument is supplied.
The constructor does not allow any appointment over 240 minutes. The constructor
calculates the appointment ending time based on the start time and the duration. Also
include a display function for the DentalAppointment class. Write a main()function
that loops at least three times, prompting the user for DentalAppointment data and
displaying all the information. (Note, if you use the Person class display function, the zip
code will be “X”; this is acceptable.) Figure 8-35 shows the output after a typical patient
has been entered. Save the file as DentalAppointment.cpp.</p>
